# Shouty-inf.rb

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 1000m can hear it.

If you are attending an Infrastructure Mapping/DevOps course, you will take Shouty from development concept to production.

## Pre-requisites

Install Docker:

* [Windows 10](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi)
* Windows <10:

   Docker does not install natively in other Windows platforms, therefore you shall need to install VirtualBox first to run a virtual machine.

   * `vagrant init phusion/ubuntu-14.04-amd64`
